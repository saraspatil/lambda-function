	# lambda function
  • Sometimes we need to declare a function without any name. The nameless property function is called an anonymous function or lambda function.
	
	• The lambda function is used for instant use.
	
	• Lambda functions are more useful when we pass a function as an argument to another function
	
	• Lambda function is used when we required a nameless function for a short period of time.
	
	• It is one line as well as nameless function.
	
	• Lambda by default contains return statement.
	
	• We use lambda function as an arguments of higher order functions(filter, map, reduce).

	• Using lambda we can write vey concise code , so that it helps to increase readability of the code.
